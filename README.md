#### OSU Bootcamp
This website was used to teach Module 11 (Express.js). 

***Module 11 skills learned:***
* Used Express.js to create a Node.js web server.
* Set up GET routes to serve selective JSON data based on parameters (*req.param* and *req.query*).
* Used Heroku to deploy a server and learned about the difference between development and production environments.
* Created POST routes to allow your server to accept incoming data and tested it with Insomnia.
* Learned how and why to use middleware in Express.js.
* Updated your server to serve client-side code for users to interface with.
* Revisited the Fetch API to make requests to your server.
* Modularized and scaled your API by using the Express.js Router.
* Tested your application using Jest and helped make it predictable as you scaled up.
